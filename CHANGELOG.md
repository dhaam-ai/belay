# Changelog

All notable changes to belay are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and belay follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) — with the caveat
that only `pkg/belay` carries a compatibility promise. Everything under
`internal/` may change in any release.

## v0.1.2 — 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **The lint gate now judges the run's change, not the repository's
  history.** With `review.mode: lint`, belay ran golangci-lint over every
  package and counted every finding. In a repository with existing lint
  debt, every run failed the gate whatever it changed, and the fix step then
  asked the agent to repair findings in files the run never touched. belay
  now passes `--new-from-rev=HEAD`, golangci-lint's own option for reporting
  only findings on lines that differ from the last commit. New files count
  as changed. A package that does not compile still fails the gate, changed
  or not.

  The scoping needs git on `PATH` and a repository with at least one commit.
  Without them, golangci-lint prints a warning and reports every finding, as
  before. Uncommitted edits made before the run count as part of its change.
  ESLint and Ruff still report every finding.

## v0.1.1 — 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- **Claude subscription tokens now reach Claude Code.** belay passed
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to the `claude` child process but dropped
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, the token `claude setup-token` issues to a Claude
  Pro, Max, Team or Enterprise subscription. A user signed in that way saw
  every run fail at the plan step: `claude` exited 1 in about a second, at no
  cost and with no error text. belay now passes the token and redacts its
  value from the journal, logs and recorded cassettes, as it already did for
  the API key.
- **A failed `claude` run now says why.** When the CLI cannot start a run, for
  example because it is signed out or its credential was rejected, it prints
  the reason as an `is_error` result on stdout, writes nothing to stderr, and
  exits 1. belay reported only the exit code and the command line. It now
  reports the CLI's reason, such as `Not logged in · Please run /login`,
  redacted like everything else it records.
- A dry run reports whether `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set, and the
  "not signed in" warning no longer appears when it is.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-09-06

First release. belay runs an autonomous coding agent as a state-machine graph
whose state is journaled after every step, so a crashed run resumes from the
last completed node instead of restarting.

### Added

- **`belay run`** — plan, approve, code, write, test, fix, review. Stops at the
  plan for a human to read, and prints its budget ceiling before it spends
  anything. `--dry-run` resolves everything and creates nothing.
- **`belay resume`** — continues a paused or crashed run. With no run id it
  picks the most recent resumable one and says which it picked.
- **`belay runs`** — lists this workspace's runs, newest first, with status,
  age, goal text and cost. A damaged run directory is listed as `unreadable`
  rather than silently omitted.
- **`belay timeline`** — one run's execution order, timing and per-node cost,
  with loop iterations numbered (`test #2/3`) so a fix loop is visible rather
  than inferred.
- **Durable, resumable runs.** An append-only NDJSON journal, fsynced per
  record. The dispatcher applies a node's state patch *before* journaling that
  it finished, so a crash re-runs a node rather than skipping one whose effects
  never landed.
- **Quality-gated loop.** A failing test suite and a failed quality gate both
  route back to `fix`, bounded by `graph.give_up`. golangci-lint, ESLint and
  ruff ship as gates; SonarQube is available via CLI or its MCP server.
- **Budget ceilings.** Token and USD spend is tracked per node and checked
  before each one. Estimated costs are marked as estimates.
- **Polyglot targets.** Go, Node and Python test runners and linters are
  detected automatically; any command can be configured explicitly.
- **Best-of-N.** `fanout` prepares N isolated candidate workspaces and `join`
  selects a winner by a configurable rule. Off by default.

### Known limitations

- **One agent backend.** Only Claude Code ships. `belay.AgentBackend` is
  exported and stable so others can be written, but none is implemented or
  tested (ADR 0005).
- **Unix only.** `internal/exec`, `internal/runner` and `internal/linter` are
  `//go:build unix`. Windows is not supported and no Windows artifact is built.
- **Promoting a fanout winner is manual.** Candidates are directory copies, so
  belay records which one won and leaves merging it to you (ADR 0004).
- **A cassette replays the agent, not the workspace.** Replay serves recorded
  responses; it does not reproduce the file edits the agent made, so a replayed
  run diverges as soon as a real test runner reads the workspace (ADR 0009,
  amended).
- **No published fix-rate figure.** `test/fixrate` is the instrument that would
  produce one against the seeded-defect catalogue; no number is claimed here.
